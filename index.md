_Glyph Seeker_ is a 3D first person action game where the main character has 4 types of runes, each one has a different type of shooting ability (specifically: _Electric_, _Explosive_, _Shield_ and _Dematerializer_).

**_Feature(s)_**

- 4 different types of shooting abilities (runes)
    - I worked mainly on the blue one, the Shield, and offered to help on the purple one, the Dematerializer
- A complex saving system, but not implemented due to the little time the team had
