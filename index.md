_Glyph Seeker_ is a 3D first person action game where the main character has 4 types of runes, each one has a different type of shooting ability (specifically: _Electric_, _Explosive_, _Shield_ and _Dematerializer_). She will use those abilitis to solve puzzles and make her way out from all enemies.

**_Feature(s)_**

- 4 different types of shooting abilities (runes)
    - I worked mainly on the blue one, the Shield, and offered help to the purple one, the Dematerializer
- A complex saving system, but not implemented due to the little time the team had
    - [[Here]](https://github.com/NautilusAcademy/GlyphSeeker/blob/Salvataggio_e_Opzioni/Proj_GlyphSeeker/Assets/Script/-Saves%20%2B%20Options/SaveManager.cs) is the code
