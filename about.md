## Education background

I began studying STEM at the Scientific High School (Liceo Scientifico) in my home town, which I graduated from in 2021.

From there, I chose to study Game Development (Programming & Design) at the Nautilus Academy, from which I earned my _Professional & Advanced Certificate_ in _Game Development_ (in 2023 and 2024, respectively).


## Work & Skills

<!-- Other knowledge -->

#### &emsp;&emsp; Programming Skills

As for programming and code, I learned C and C++ languages in high school, and then C# and Unity in Nautilus Academy.

These are my programming skills, organized in a table

| Level          | Languages | Engines       |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| `Intermediate` | C#        | Unity         |
| `Beginner`     | C++       | Unreal Engine |


## Personal interests

<!-- Ma basta parlare di tecnicismi, andiamo sui miei interessi! -->
But enough talking of technical things, let's talk more about my interests!

A have a variety of interests and hobbies, but they can be boiled down in two main ones: **Art** and **STEM subjects**, or &ndash; more specifically &ndash;  pixel-art, mathemathics and physics.

### &emsp; STEM subjects

I was always interested in STEM subjects from a young age, _____ like complex machines (some can be "[Rude-Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine)" <!--Scambia con https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macchina_di_Rube_Goldberg--> contraptions), mechanical parts that interact with one another (like how cogs work) and somewhat challenging puzzles.

My programming love also began from a really young age, using command blocks in Minecraft &ndash; blocks that can handle a line of code inside and can create some cool machines or make happen some really cool things happen when they are been put together.

<elim>All this interests brought me</elim> towards the Scientific High school, in which I chose the section with computer science, where I studied STEM subjects such as maths, physics, chemistry/biology and &ndash; of course &ndash; computer science. This was my very first experience with real programming and coding.

As I began the last years of high school, my love towards maths and physics grew even more thanks to the connection of both of them with the universe and my teachers, and I stil love them to this day.

My interest with coding verted onto  videogames because they are a combination of all my favourite interests:

- Art and its many forms (including digital artworks, animation, etc);
- Sinceund (Music and SFX, sound effects);
- Video and Photography (mostly filmmaking principles);
- UI and UX (user experience, how users/players can interact with the UI);
- Coding and Programming (last but not least)

Not only that, but it can very much bring out the creativity and insipiration to create stories, interact with people and sometime even reach their heart.

### &emsp; Hobbies

#### &emsp;&mdash; Art

Art is always been an hobby of mine, from admiring art pieces at display at museums to animations and its principles. I also started experimenting with pixel-art when I was in middle school and messing around with Minecraft textures, from which I gained a lot of experience with it. Some of my late art can be found on my [Art page](https://greenhat.straw.page/myart) organized as a portfolio (still a WIP), but also on my [Bluesky](https://hatmadeofgreen.bsky.social) account or [Twitter ("X")](https://twitter.com/hatmadeofgreen) account.

#### &emsp;&mdash; Translations

Another passion of mine is translating some English text or songs in Italian (or vice-versa) in my free time, keeping it up with the prosody/metre while trying to maintain the original meaning at the same time. I've started doing this to improve my English skills while learning some music theory in the process... and just like that, it became a recurring hobby!


### &emsp; Other interests

Another thing I'm keen on is Psychology, more like the study of the smallest detail of  & the more intricate ways of _why_ things work the way they work. Sometimes even the reasons behind people choices and how .

<elim>Yet</elim> another interest is Phylosophy, especially
